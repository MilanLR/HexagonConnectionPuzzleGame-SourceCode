# HexagonConnectionPuzzleGame-SourceCode
This is the source code for a small puzzle game I made.
The game is inspired by a minigame from "Mages of Mystralia".

I made the game because I wanted a math challange with hexagon grids and wanted more levels to play, so I made it randomized.


The webversion is available [here](https://milanlr.github.io/HexagonConnectionPuzzleGame/).
